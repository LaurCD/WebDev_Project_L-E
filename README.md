This project aims to satisfy John O'Reilly with an aesthetically pleasing website that draws in pontential new customers for his business "Wheels on Fire". So far, we have built the foundations of the website using HTML. We have also designed a decent part of the website. We have made the website accessible to those who are colour blind (upon our clients request), people who have dyslexia, and also to those who have autism or are neurodivergent.
